### Step 2: Add new phone number

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="phone" title="Add a WhatsApp phone number">
    You can add a new phone number in three ways: by getting a phone number provided by Cogfy, by bringing your own existing phone number to use with Cogfy, or by connecting a WhatsApp Business App number in coexistence mode.

    Each option has its own setup process, allowing you to choose the method that best fits your needs.

    > To connect your phone number, visit [messenger.cogfy.com/:WORKSPACE/new-phone-number](https://messenger.cogfy.com/:WORKSPACE/new-phone-number).

</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Create assistant and connect to phone number

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="star" title="Create an assistant">
    To create a new assistant, navigate to the Assistants route in Cogfy Messenger and click on the "Create" button.

    This will create a new assistant with empty settings and redirect you to the assistant's details page, then you can click on "Edit" to configure its properties.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon='link' title="Connect assistant to phone number">
    After creating your assistant, you need to link it to your WhatsApp phone number to enable messaging capabilities.

    Go to the Phone Numbers route, select your phone number, and setup a rule to connect it to your newly created assistant.
