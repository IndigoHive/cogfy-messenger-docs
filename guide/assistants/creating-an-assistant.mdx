## Create

To create a new assistant, navigate to the Assistants route in Cogfy Messenger and click on the "Create" button.

This will create a new assistant with empty settings and redirect you to the assistant's details page, where you can further configure its properties.

## Edit assistant


The Edit Assistant Form page allows you to customize the details and behavior of an assistant. On this page, you can change the assistant’s name, select the language model it will use, and adjust configuration parameters such as temperature, verbosity, and reasoning effort.

You can also write or update instructions that guide how the assistant responds to users, using dynamic placeholders to personalize its messages. The form makes it easy to insert contact-related properties and save your changes, helping you tailor the assistant to your specific needs.
