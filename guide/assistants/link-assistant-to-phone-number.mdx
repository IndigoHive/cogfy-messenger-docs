To link an assistant to a phone number, you need to define rules that determine which assistant will be used for specific conversations. These rules allow you to automate the assignment of assistants based on contact information, message type, tags, and other properties.

### Managing Assistant Rules

   </Step>
   <Step title="Configure Rule Conditions">
      Use the condition editor to specify criteria such as contact name, email, occupation, tags, message type, and more. You can combine multiple conditions using logical operators.
   </Step>
   <Step title="Select an Assistant">
      For each rule, select the assistant to be used when the conditions are met. Assistants are listed by name; if an assistant does not have a name, it will appear as "Unnamed Assistant."
   </Step>
   <Step title="Save Changes">
      After configuring your rules and selecting assistants, save your changes. The system will automatically apply the rules to incoming conversations.

### Rule Priority

Rules are evaluated in order. The first rule that matches the conversation will determine which assistant is assigned. You can reorder rules by adding them to the top or bottom of the list.

### Managing Rules

- **Edit Conditions:** Modify the conditions for each rule to fine-tune when an assistant should be used.
- **Delete Rules:** Remove rules that are no longer needed.
- **Tags and Message Types:** Use tags and message types to create more specific rules for your workflow.

This process helps ensure that conversations are routed to the most appropriate assistant, improving efficiency and user experience.
