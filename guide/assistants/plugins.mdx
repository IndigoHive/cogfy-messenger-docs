Plugins allow you to extend the capabilities of an assistant by integrating external services and custom functionalities.
On the plugins tab, you can add, update, duplicate, enable or disable, and delete plugins for your assistant.

Each plugin can be configured to connect with different tools, such as Google Calendar, and you can manage all plugin settings directly from the interface.
This makes it easy to customize how your assistant interacts with other systems and automates tasks according to your needs.
