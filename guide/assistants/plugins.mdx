Plugins allow you to extend the capabilities of an assistant by integrating external services and custom functionalities.
On the plugins tab, you can add, update, duplicate, enable or disable, and delete plugins for your assistant.

Each plugin can be configured to connect with different tools, such as Google Calendar, and you can manage all plugin settings directly from the interface.
This makes it easy to customize how your assistant interacts with other systems and automates tasks according to your needs.


## Example Plugins

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion title="Assistant">
    The Assistant plugin allows you to integrate and configure AI assistants within your application. You can select an assistant, define its interaction strategy (Delegate or Orchestrate), and provide a description.

    The **Delegate strategy** lets the assistant directly use another assistant’s response.

    The **Orchestrate strategy** enables the assistant to process the response further before delivering the final answer.

    This plugin is designed to streamline assistant management and enhance collaborative AI workflows.

  <Accordion title="Contact">
    The Contact plugin allows your assistant to access and manage user contact information, making it easier to personalize interactions and provide relevant assistance.

    The Contact plugin works seamlessly with the [Link assistant to phone number](/guide/assistants/link-assistant-to-phone-number) feature, enabling advanced automation and personalization in your conversations. By leveraging the Contact plugin, your assistant can update user tags in real time as conversations progress. These tags are then used as conditions in the assistant rules, allowing you to dynamically route conversations to the most appropriate assistant based on user behavior, interests, or profile changes.
