The Assistants route provides an interface for managing all assistants within your workspace.

An assistant will only work when it is configured on a phone number.
To activate and use an assistant, make sure it is linked to a valid phone number in the system. Without this configuration, the assistant cannot interact with users or handle conversations.

<Info>

You can set up which assistant will be used by creating and managing rules for each phone number.
These rules allow you to define conditions and select the appropriate assistant based on contact properties, tags, or message types, ensuring the right assistant responds in each situation.
