title: "Cogs"
description: "The building blocks of an Engine's workflow"

As you may have seen in the previous chapter about workflows, cogs are the individual instructions that make up an
Engine's workflow. There is no secret: each cog represents a specific action, and they are executed in the order they
are arranged in the workflow.

There are a couple of different types of cogs, and we will keep releasing new ones in the future.

In this chapter, we will go throuhg different types of cogs available in Cogfy Messenger and how to configure them.

## Send Message cog


The Send Message cog is used to send a predefined message to the user.

Because messages can be reused in multiple places and some of them can be quite complex (for example, Whatsapp Flows),
we decided to move the creation of messages to a separate section called "Messages", as you can find in the sidebar.

After having at least one message created, you configure a Send Message cog to reference one of those messages in the
cog's dropdown, as shown below.
