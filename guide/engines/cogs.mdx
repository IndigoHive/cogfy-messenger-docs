title: "Cogs"
description: "The building blocks of an Engine's workflow"
---

As you may have seen in the previous chapter about workflows, cogs are the individual instructions that make up an
Engine's workflow. There is no secret: each cog represents a specific action, and they are executed in the order they
are arranged in the workflow.

There are a couple of different types of cogs, and we will keep releasing new ones in the future.

In this chapter, we will go throuhg different types of cogs available in Cogfy Messenger and how to configure them.

## Send Message cog

The Send Message cog is used to send a predefined message to the user.

Because messages can be reused in multiple places and some of them can be quite complex (for example, Whatsapp Flows),
we decided to move the creation of messages to a separate section called "Messages", as you can find in the sidebar.

After having at least one message created, you configure a Send Message cog to reference one of those messages in the
cog's dropdown, as shown below.

## Run Assistant cog

The Run Assistant cog is used to run a Engine Assistant to generate a reply, considering the current conversation
context.

<Info>
Not to be confused with with the old Cogfy Assistants: Engine Assistants are a new concept of assistants that are scoped
by Engine and meant to be used by Engines only.
</Info>

Because of the complexity and reusability of configuring an Engine Assistant, we also moved their creation to a separate
section called "Assistants", which is covered in the Assistants chapter of this guide.

## Router cog

The Router cog is used to route the workflow execution to different paths based on certain conditions.

Conditions can be configured by clicking on the pencil icon on the right of each path cog, which will prompt a modal
where you can intuitively set up conditions, as follows:

As long as there aren't any typos, this path will only be matched if the first name is equal to King and the second name
is equal to Witcher.

<Info>
After executing every matching path, the workflow execution will continue after the router cog.
</Info>

<Warning>
Currently, if more than one path's conditions are met, every matching path will be executed in the order they are defined in the
router cog. In the future, this behavior will be optional.
</Warning>
