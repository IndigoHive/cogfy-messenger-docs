An engine is a core component that powers how Cogfy Messenger handles messages, makes decitions, takes actions and
generates replies in a step-by-step, decision-tree fashion, as you can see below.

If you didn't guess already, don't worry: we'll explain all of this in more detail in the following sections of this
guide, as well as how to create and "publish" engines so they can be used in your workspace.

## Creating

To create your first engine, go to the "Engines" section in the sidebar and click on the "Create" button. A new engine
will be instantly created.

## Setting on a phone number

In order to use an engine to handle incoming messages, you need **publish** it to a phone number.
For that, select a phone number from the top of the sidebar, then click the ellipsis icon and select "Publish Engine".

After publishing, all incoming messages to that phone number will be handled by the selected engine instead of the
default assistant rules handler.
