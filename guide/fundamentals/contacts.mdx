Contacts are created automatically whenever someone sends a message to your assistant’s phone number. You can also pre-register contacts manually, allowing you to assign tags, names, emails, and other details in advance — making it easier to organize users and deliver personalized communication from the start.

On the Contacts page, you can view a contact’s full details, including their properties, the phone numbers they have interacted with, and any OAUTH accounts connected through the assistant.

> To manage contacts, visit [messenger.cogfy.com/:WORKSPACE/contacts](https://messenger.cogfy.com/:WORKSPACE/contacts).
